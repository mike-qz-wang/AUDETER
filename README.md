# AUDETER: A Large-scale Dataset for Deepfake Audio Detection in Open Worlds

## Dataset Description

We introduce AUDETER (AUdio DEepfake TEst Range), a large-scale, highly diverse deepfake audio dataset for comprehensive evaluation and robust development of generalised models for deepfake audio detection. It consists of over 4,500 hours of synthetic audio generated by 11 recent TTS models and 10 vocoders with a broad range of TTS/vocoder patterns, totalling 3 million audio clips.
